        - Critical (S1): The bug causes a complete system crash, data loss, or renders the application unusable (e.g., login failure, app freezes). 
        - Major (S2): A core feature is broken with no viable workaround (e.g., checkout fails, search returns no results). 
        - Minor (S3): The bug affects functionality but the system remains usable; a workaround exists (e.g., date format error, minor UI misalignment). 
        - Cosmetic (S4): No functional impact; issues are visual (e.g., typos, color mismatches, button alignment). 
        - Low/Trivial (S5): Minimal or no impact; often minor enhancements or style issues.
